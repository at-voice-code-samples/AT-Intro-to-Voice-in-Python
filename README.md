# A Basic Voice based application

This is a simple Flask based application that does two things
- Converts text to speech using the `Say` call function
- Plays a pre-recorded media file from a CDN using the `Play` call function

## Running this app

Clone this repo to your machine and run `source ./venv/bin/activate`. This will create a new Python virtual environment with all the dependencies pre-installed. 

## Running the app with Docker

Coming soon

## Testing the app's response

Use Postman to check what the application returns.
